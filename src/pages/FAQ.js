            <p className='faq-question'>Q: Do I need to know how to code in order to join the Hackathon?</p>
            <p>A: No, you don't. Although, this year we introduced the Software/AI track, teams can decide whether they want to follow that track. If a team only wants to focus on design or coding, that is totally fine. If a team decides to incorporate both coding and design into their project, they are more than welcome to do so.</p>
